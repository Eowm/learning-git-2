  <h1>Shawn Mendes - In My Blood</h1>
  <p>Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood<br><br>
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?</p>
